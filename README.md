- This package provides the functions to compute the ALRP (adaptive lasso based on robust pariwise correlations) and ALGR (adaptive lasso based on Gaussrank correlations)
proposed by Peng, Samuel and Garth.

- We added a demonstration (demo), a simulation workflow (simu) and two real data applications (boston and breastcancer) in vignettes

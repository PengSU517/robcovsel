# SelectionViaRobCov

- Script "robcov.R" is used to compute robust covariance matrices via the pairwise correlation or the Gaussrank correlation.
- Script "roblasso.R" is used to do variable selection based on the estimated robust covariance matrices we obtain(using package "lars").
- You could use "test.R" to have a try!
- "breastcancer.R" is a real data application using the Breast Cancer dataset. The original dataset is too large to upload so we just uploaded a screened dataset "breastcancer_screened.csv".
